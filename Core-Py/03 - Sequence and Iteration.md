# Week 03 - Sequence and Iteration
Week 3 has introduced sequence and iteration within Python programming. This has included the use of the WHILE loop.

## Task 01: Guessing Game
Create a guessing game program that asks the user to enter in a number between 1 and 10. ​

Generate a random number and display whether the user got this correct, if they do not get it correct, have the game continue. When they get it correct, end the loop. and display a congrats message.

> As an extension to the above program, display on the screen whether the number they guessed is higher or lower than the answer.

> Create a score variable, each time the user correctly guesses the number, add 1 to the score. Allow for the user to continue playing until they type in the word “exit”.​ Display their final score at the end​
