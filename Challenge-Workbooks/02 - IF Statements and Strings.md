# Week 02 - Strings and IFs
Week 2 has been looking at the use of relational operators, string handling and IF statements within Python programming.

There are two tasks for you to complete:
1. [Luggage System](#task-01-luggage-entry)
2. [Login System](#task-02-login-system)

## Task 01: Luggage Entry
A new airplane company called "Plane Sailing" have a policy in place for their customers, this states that each customer can bring up to 100kg of luggage with them onto the flight, otherwise there is a £1.00 excess charge per 5kg over.  

Using IF statements, create a program that does the following:

**Inputs**
+ "How much kg does your luggage weigh?"

**Processing**
+ Calculates whether above 100kg
+ Calculate cost owed by customer

**Outputs**
+ When above 100kg, display there is a £1 excess for each 5kg over
+ Display what customer needs to pay based upon their luggage amount e.g. 110kg = £2 excess charge

## Task 02: Login System
Create a program called – Login System​, details below have been provided:
+ Create a program that allows for the user to login to the system.​
+ Ask the user to input their username and password​
+ When they’re correct, display “Welcome username”

Within the login screen, only allow a maximum of 3 attempts, if the details are incorrect 3 times in a row, exit the program.​
